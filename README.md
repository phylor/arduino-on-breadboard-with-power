# Arduino on a Breadboard with Power Supply

This is a basic reference implementation of an Arduino on a breadboard using an external power supply circuit. The power supply circuit is separated as a module so that it can be easily reused in different projects. The modules are connected using jumper wires and sockets (Dupont wires).
